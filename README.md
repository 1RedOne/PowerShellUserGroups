# PowerShellUserGroups
A community-maintained, single-source list of PowerShell user groups worldwide.

# Purpose
This list is a central repository of PowerShell user groups that can be updated by the community and used as a source file for other lists and websites. 

Because it is easy to edit, it is likely to be more accurate than other sources. And, because it's a central source, rather than a list that one person assembled, it's likely to be more complete. 

Anyone can contribute. External sites can link to this page without seeking permission. Everyone wins. 

We encourage people to link, rather than copy, to keep the data fresh and accurate.
