# PowerShellUserGroups
A list of PowerShell User Groups Collected and Centralized

# Purpose
This list will be used as a centralized repository of user groups that can be updated by the community as opposed to relying on a single website, or multiple sites, for curation.  Anyone can contribute.  External sites can link to this page freely.  Everyone wins.
