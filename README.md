# PowerShellUserGroups
A community-maintained, single-source list of PowerShell user groups worldwide.

# Purpose
This list is a central repository of PowerShell user groups that can be updated by the community and used as a source file for other lists and websites. 

Because it is easy to edit, it is likely to be more accurate than other sources. And, because it's a central source, rather than a list that one person assembled, it's likely to be more complete. 

Anyone can contribute. External sites can link to this page without seeking permission. Everyone wins. 

We encourage people to link, rather than copy, to keep the data fresh and accurate.

# Guidance and Governance
We're still working on the standards surrounding what information to offer and how governance will be administered.  We want to keep this conversation open.  If you want to raise a suggestion, concern, or ways to improve what we're doing, feel free to raise an issue on this repo and we can all talk about it together!
